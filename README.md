# goFile is a personal tool to generate go directories

It will create a go directory with common files and syntax already inputted 
It takes in an optional flag files, which is an array argument of files to include

	./goFile files-hello.go goodbye.go

If you decide to just stick to what is automatically generated, then merely running the command
in the desired directory will look like this:
	./gofile

# This is part of a larger contribution to a containerized vim set up with STD and my current .vimrc
# Coming soon...
